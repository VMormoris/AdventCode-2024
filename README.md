# Advent code solutions

The code it's gonna be wonky, I'm basically learning [zig](https://ziglang.org/) while doing the puzzles.

To test with your inputs, you can copy the files into the `input.txt` of the relative day and part. And run from desired day: `zig run part1/main.zig` or `zig run part2/main.zig`.

| Day | Stars |
| --: | :---: |
| 1st | [*](./day1/part1/README.md)[*](./day1/part2/README.md) |
| 2nd | [*](./day2/part1/README.md)[*](./day2/part2/README.md) |
| 3rd | [*](./day3/part1/README.md)[*](./day3/part2/README.md) |
